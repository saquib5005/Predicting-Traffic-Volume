<h2 align="left">📝 Project Description:</h2>

<p align="left">
Built a PyTorch-powered traffic prediction system! Using time-series skills and deep learning knowledge, I predicted hourly traffic on interstate highways, considering seasonality and trends. With exploratory data analysis 🔍, feature engineering 🛠️, model training 🏋️‍♂️, and evaluation 📈, I've built a system to help you navigate the roads! 🚗💨

<h2 align="left">📋 Project Instructions:</h2>

<p align="left">
Build a deep learning model that predicts traffic volume and helps tackle challenges like congestion 🚧, road design 🛣️, and smarter commutes 🕒:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Build a deep learning model using PyTorch to predict the traffic volume using the provided dataset. Initialize and save this model as <code>'traffic_model'</code>.</li>
<li>Train and evaluate your model using an appropriate loss function. Save the final training loss as a tensor variable, <code>'final_training_loss'</code> (aim for less than 20).</li>
<li>Predict the traffic volume against the test set and evaluate the performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE). Save your result as a tensor float, <code>'test_mse'</code>.</li>
</ul>

Here's how I approached building this traffic prediction system step by step:
</p>

<details open>
<summary><strong>1. Prepare the Data for Modeling 📊</strong></summary>
<p>To model time-series data, you need to generate sequences of past values as inputs and predict the next value as the target. One way to do this is by writing a function and passing in the available data. These then need to be converted to PyTorch tensors and loaded.</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating sequences with a function 📉</li>
<li>Converting to tensors 🧮</li>
<li>Loading data 📥</li>
</ul>
</details>
<br>


<details open>
<summary><strong>2. Creating a Neural Network Model 🧠</strong></summary>
<p>Select and build an appropriate neural network that is good at handling time series data. Consider using Recurrent Neural Networks, which are designed to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choosing the right neural network 🤖</li>
<li>Defining the <code>__init__()</code> method and RNN Layer ⚙️</li>
<li>Selecting an activation function 🔥</li>
<li>Writing the forward method ➡️</li>
</ul>
</details>
<br>


<details open>
<summary><strong>3. Training the Model 🏃‍♂️</strong></summary>
<p>Set up and train the neural network model to predict traffic volume. This involves initializing the model, selecting an appropriate loss function and optimizer, and running the training loop for multiple epochs to minimize the loss function.</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializing the model 🌱</li>
<li>Choosing the loss function 📉</li>
<li>Selecting an optimizer 🎯</li>
<li>Running a training loop 🔁</li>
</ul>
</details>
<br>


<details open>
<summary><strong>4. Evaluating the Model 📐</strong></summary>
<p>After training the model, evaluating its performance on unseen data (test set) is essential. This step involves running the model in evaluation mode, collecting the predictions, and comparing them to the actual labels using an appropriate metric.</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting evaluation mode 🛑</li>
<li>Running on evaluation loop 🔄</li>
<li>Calculating the MSE 📊</li>
</ul>
</details>
